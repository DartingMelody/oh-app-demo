# OH App Demo

This app is intended for development and demonstration of the reusable Django
app, [django-open-humans](https://www.github.com/OpenHumans/django-open-humans/)

## Local Deployment and Development
The *OH App Demo* is written in *Python 3.6+*, uses the *Django 2.0* framework and is designed to be ultimately deployed
to *Heroku*. You will need some additional modules and packages to locally experiment with this uploader template or to develop it further. A full step-by-step guide that should work for Mac OS (and with minor differences for Linux) [can be found in the INSTALL.md](https://github.com/OpenHumans/oh-app-demo/blob/master/INSTALL.md).
